This repository contains all files related to te second assignment for the course Software Testing and Reverse Engineering. Included in this repo are the source problem files and output files generated by KLEE and LearnLib.

Also included are 2 jar files that were used to run the LearnLib learning process and the custom code used to convert KLEE output into a diagram. 

To run LearnLib use the command 

```java -jar learnlib.jar -e \[executable (string)\] -a \[input alphabet (integer)\]```

To view all options, run the jar with -h option.

To run the KLEE output visualiser after running KLEE and generating a statedump, use the command

```java -jar kleevisualiser \[statedump file\] \[file format (default pdf)\]```

The visualiser might run for a long time and result in an unviewable result if the statedump is too large.

The KLEE problem code was compiled using 

```clang -I /home/klee/klee_src/include -emit-llvm -g -c problem.c -o problem.bc```

and run using

```klee -emit-all-errors problem.bc```

within the KLEE docker container. To install this container, follow the instructions on the KLEE website.
